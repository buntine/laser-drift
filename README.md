# Laser Drift

Laser Drift is a collection of tools that allow you to remotely control your [Carrera Digital 132/124](http://www.carrera-toys.com/en/) race track by emulating the infrared wireless controllers for between one and four players simultaneously.

Laser Drift allows you to control the speed and lane change status of your cars in realtime via a simple language sent over TCP. It will also abstract away the messiness involved in tasks like reverse-engineering infrared signals, identifying individual players and syncing with the IR tower.

This system acts as a low level interface into a Carrera slot car set and is intended to be used to build higher lever applications.  See the [frontends](#Frontends) section for some examples of things you can do with this system.
